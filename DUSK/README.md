# Dimensionless units software kit

The dimensionless units software kit (DUSK) is an experimental software kit
available for testing by researchers and scientists.  It works with
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) through the
[units](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/units/index.html) package and
with anything else that builds on the
[UDUNITS2](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/) library.

The purpose of this kit is to experiment with new approaches to units for
counted quantities and ratios of two quantities of the same kind.  These new
approaches diverge from standard practice and do not represent official
positions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
Motivational background and explanation can be found in the following papers:
(1) Peter J. Mohr and William D. Phillips, [Dimensionless units in the
SI](https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/52/1/40), (2) David Flater,
[Architecture for Software-Assisted Quantity
Calculus](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.1943) (Section 6), and (3)
[Redressing grievances with the treatment of dimensionless quantities in
SI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2017.05.043).

Being experimental, the software kit is not a complete implementation of the
architecture described and is not expected to be free of problems.
